5. Follow the GitHub workflow in [github-workflow-standards.md](./github-workflow-standards.md) for version control
6. Use the database schema template in [database-schema-documentation.md](./database-schema-documentation.md) to document your database structure

## üìù Documentation Requirements

Every document in the project must follow these requirements:

1. **Emoji Usage**: All documents must use emojis for section headers and key points to enhance readability and visual organization
2. **Mermaid Diagrams**: All workflows and processes must be visualized using Mermaid diagrams
3. **Consistent Header Hierarchy**: Follow the header structure defined in the formatting standards
4. **Jump Links**: Include navigation links at the top of documents longer than 100 lines
5. **Code Blocks**: All code snippets must be properly formatted with language specification

## üîÑ Documentation Workflow

1. Start with initial conversation to define project scope and requirements
2. Use AI to generate initial draft documentation using the templates
3. Refine documentation with specific project details
4. Maintain documentation throughout the development process
5. Update task statuses and progress in the task log

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Documentation Files

Every project should maintain these core documentation files:

1. **project-overview.md**: High-level overview of the project
2. **dev.md**: Technical documentation for developers
3. **file-tree.md**: Project file structure and organization
4. **task-list.md**: List of tasks and their statuses
5. **task-log.md**: Ongoing log of development activities

## üéØ Task Status Legend

- üî¥ Not Started
- üü° In Progress
- üü¢ Completed
- ‚≠ïÔ∏è Blocked
- üîµ Testing
- ‚úÖ Verified

## üìä Documentation Update Order

When making changes to the project, update documentation in this order:

1. First update **file-tree.md** if the structure has changed
2. Next update **dev.md** with implementation details
3. Then update **task-list.md** with task status changes
4. Finally update **task-log.md** with a summary of changes made
