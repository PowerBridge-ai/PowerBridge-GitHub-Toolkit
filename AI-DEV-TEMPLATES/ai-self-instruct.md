## üß† Meta-Instructions for AI Agents

### 1. Initial System Assessment

When engaging with a new project, perform these steps without being prompted:

1. **Document Discovery**
   ```
   # Search for core documentation files
   find . -name "task-log.md" -o -name "dev-notes.md" -o -name "file-tree.md" -o -name "DATABASE_SCHEMA.md"
   ```

2. **Project Structure Assessment**
   ```
   # Identify main codebase components
   find . -type d -not -path "*/\.*" | sort
   ```

3. **Technology Stack Identification**
   ```
   # Look for configuration files
   find . -name "package.json" -o -name "requirements.txt" -o -name "Cargo.toml" -o -name "go.mod"
   ```

4. **Database Environment Verification**
   ```bash
   # Check database configuration
   grep -r "DB_" --include="*.env" --include="*.yml" --include="*.config" .
   
   # For PostgreSQL projects
   PGPASSWORD="ATI123#4567" psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d database_name -c "\dt" | cat
   ```

### 2. Documentation Initialization

If core documentation is missing, initialize it without being asked:

1. **Core Documentation Creation**
   ```
   # Create the three core files
   mkdir -p src/APP_NAME/dev/
   touch src/APP_NAME/dev/file-tree.md
   touch src/APP_NAME/dev/dev-notes.md
   touch task-log.md
   ```

2. **Template Application**
   ```
   # Apply templates from core-documentation-templates.md
   # Start with project overview, then file-tree, then dev-notes, then task-log
   ```

3. **Documentation Structure Standardization**
   ```
   # Format all documentation according to document-formatting-standards.md
