# ü§ñ AI-Guided Q&A Session Template

## üéØ Purpose
This template provides a standardized approach for AI agents to conduct effective Q&A sessions that extract comprehensive project information from developers. The goal is to systematically gather all necessary details to populate the cursor rules template, ensuring AI tools can understand and follow project-specific requirements and conventions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Session Preparation

Before starting the Q&A session, the AI should:

1. **Review existing project documentation**
   - Check for existing READMEs, wikis, or documentation files
   - Note any specific technologies or frameworks mentioned
   - Identify potential areas that may need clarification

2. **Familiarize with the codebase structure**
   - Scan directory structure to understand project organization
   - Identify key files and components
   - Note any naming patterns or organization schemes

3. **Prepare session materials**
   - Have cursor rules template ready for reference
   - Create a scratchpad for taking notes during the session
   - Prepare initial questions based on existing information

## üëã Introduction Script

Begin the session with a clear introduction:

```
I'll be guiding you through a structured Q&A session to gather information about your project. 
This will help me create comprehensive cursor rules that will enable AI tools to better understand 
your project's specific requirements and conventions.

The session will take approximately 30-45 minutes, covering areas such as:
- Project overview and architecture
- Development environment and tools
- Code organization and conventions
- Testing and deployment processes
- Database management and documentation requirements

Feel free to elaborate on any questions, and I'll ask follow-up questions when needed. 
At the end, I'll synthesize this information into a cursor rules document that you can 
review and refine.

Are you ready to begin?
```

   - "Do you have an example file or code snippet that demonstrates this convention?"

2. **Ask for clarification**:
   - "Can you elaborate on what you mean by [term]?"
   - "I want to make sure I understand - are you saying [restatement]?"

3. **Explore exceptions**:
   - "Are there any exceptions to this rule?"
   - "Are there situations where a different approach would be preferred?"

4. **Check for documentation**:
   - "Is this documented somewhere I can reference?"
   - "Where would I find more detailed information about this?"

5. **Identify priorities**:
   - "How important is this compared to other considerations?"
   - "Is this a strict requirement or a general guideline?"

## üß† Synthesizing Responses

As you gather information:

1. **Organize information** by category (matching the cursor rules template sections)
2. **Note contradictions or ambiguities** to resolve later
3. **Identify missing information** that requires additional questions
4. **Summarize understanding** periodically to confirm accuracy
5. **Connect related information** across different categories

Example synthesis statement:
```
Based on what you've told me so far, your project uses a microservices architecture with 
Python for the backend services and React for the frontend. You follow PEP 8 for Python 
code style with additional custom rules for function naming. All database queries must 
use the ORM, and direct SQL is prohibited except in migration scripts. Is that accurate?
```

## üìù Documentation Process

After completing the questions:

1. **Organize collected information** according to the cursor rules template structure
2. **Draft clear, concise answers** for each section
3. **Include specific examples** where provided
4. **Note any areas of uncertainty** for further clarification
5. **Format the document** according to project documentation standards
6. **Add reference links** to relevant existing documentation

## üèÅ Session Conclusion

End the session with:

```
Thank you for providing this valuable information about your project. I'll now organize 
everything we've discussed into a comprehensive cursor rules document following the 
standardized template. This will help ensure all AI tools understand your project's 
specific requirements and conventions.

I'll share the draft document with you shortly for review. Please note any areas that 
need correction or additional details. Once finalized, this document will serve as the 
primary reference for AI tools working with your codebase.

Is there anything else you'd like to add before we conclude this session?
```
