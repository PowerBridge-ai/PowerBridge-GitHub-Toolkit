# ü§ñ Project Cursor Rules Template

## üìå Purpose

This template helps create comprehensive cursor rules for your project through an AI-guided Q&A process. Cursor rules ensure AI assistants understand your project's specific requirements, coding standards, and workflows.

## üìù Template Instructions

1. Use this template with the AI-guided Q&A session template
2. Answer each question with detailed, specific information
3. Include concrete examples wherever possible
4. Be explicit about requirements and constraints
5. After completion, save as `[project-name]-cursor-rules.md`
